                    <p>The question of whether computers can think is like the question of whether submarines can swim. (Edsger W. Dijkstra) Programming is like sex. One mistake and you have to support it for the rest of your life. (Michael Sinz) A good programmer is someone who always looks both ways before crossing a one-way street. (Doug Linder) Computer science education cannot make anybody an expert programmer any more than studying brushes and pigment can make somebody an expert painter. (Eric Raymond) Most of you are familiar with the virtues of a programmer. There are three, of course: laziness, impatience, and hubris. (Larry Wall)</p>
                    <p>It has been said that the great scientific disciplines are examples of giants standing on the shoulders of other giants. It has also been said that the software industry is an example of midgets standing on the toes of other midgets. (Alan Cooper) The question of whether computers can think is like the question of whether submarines can swim. (Edsger W. Dijkstra) It’s not a bug – it’s an undocumented feature. (Anonymous) The trouble with programmers is that you can never tell what a programmer is doing until it’s too late. (Seymour Cray) The only people who have anything to fear from free software are those whose products are worth even less. (David Emery)</p>
                    <p>One of the main causes of the fall of the Roman Empire was that–lacking zero–they had no way to indicate successful termination of their C programs. (Robert Firth) Without requirements or design, programming is the art of adding bugs to an empty text file. (Louis Srygley) It’s a curious thing about our industry: not only do we not learn from our mistakes, but we also don’t learn from our successes. (Keith Braithwaite) We will never become a truly paper-less society until the Palm Pilot folks come out with WipeMe 1.0. (Andy Pierson)</p>
                    <p>If debugging is the process of removing software bugs, then programming must be the process of putting them in. (Edsger Dijkstra) Software undergoes beta testing shortly before it’s released. Beta is Latin for “still doesn’t work”. (Anonymous) C++ : Where friends have access to your private members. (Gavin Russell Baker)</p>

                    <p>Before software can be reusable it first has to be usable. (Ralph Johnson) Fine, Java MIGHT be a good example of what a programming language should be like. But Java applications are good examples of what applications SHOULDN’T be like. (pixadel) We are Microsoft. Resistance Is Futile. You Will Be Assimilated. (Bumper sticker) You can’t have great software without a great team, and most software teams behave like dysfunctional families. (Jim McCarthy)</p>
                    <p>There are only two industries that refer to their customers as ‘users’. (Edward Tufte) The best thing about a boolean is even if you are wrong, you are only off by a bit. (Anonymous) 19 Jan 2038 at 3:14:07 AM (End of the word according to Unix–2^32 seconds after January 1, 1970) It has been said that the great scientific disciplines are examples of giants standing on the shoulders of other giants. It has also been said that the software industry is an example of midgets standing on the toes of other midgets. (Alan Cooper)</p>
                    <p>If debugging is the process of removing software bugs, then programming must be the process of putting them in. (Edsger Dijkstra) It’s a curious thing about our industry: not only do we not learn from our mistakes, but we also don’t learn from our successes. (Keith Braithwaite) Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live. (Martin Golding) It would appear that we have reached the limits of what it is possible to achieve with computer technology, although one should be careful with such statements, as they tend to sound pretty silly in 5 years. (John Von Neumann, circa 1949)</p>
                    <p>The first 90% of the code accounts for the first 90% of the development time. The remaining 10% of the code accounts for the other 90% of the development time. (Tom Cargill) There are two ways of constructing a software design. One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies. And the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies. (C.A.R. Hoare) Java is, in many ways, C++–. (Michael Feldman) The Internet? Is that thing still around?
